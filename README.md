### Your project idea

This is an interactive browser based synthesizer. Utilizing the fundamentals of sound synthesis through JS, the synthesizer can be tweaked, modified, and saved.

### Your tech stack (frontend, backend, database)

Frontend: JS, React, Reactronica, Tone.js, Bootstrap

Backend: Python, SQL
Database: Postgres

> be sure to include your new technology!

### List of backend models and their properties

### User stories

MVP:

- As a user, I want to push play button and have a synth sound come out of the speakers
- As a user, I want to be able to stop the synthesizer
- As a user, I want to be able to tweak the aspects of the synthesizer, using classic techniques for audio synthesis such as setting the volume, filter, adding effects and changing the synth type.
- As a user, I want user friendly controls to be able to change the synth easily

Stretch:

- As a user, I want to be able to add, edit, and delete the synths that I created so that I can access them again and delete a synth if I don't want it anymore
- As a user, I want to create a sequencer so that I have control of which notes are played and when they're played
- As a user, I want to be able to save the sequences that I like so that I can reference back to them
- As a user, I want to utilize a drum machine to accompany my synth
- As a user, I want to be able to save or delete my drum machine
- as a user, I want to be able to log in so that I can have more control over my saved synths
